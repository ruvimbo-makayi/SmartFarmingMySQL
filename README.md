<h1>Smart Farming DB – MySQL Query Project</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to the <strong>Smart Farming DB</strong> SQL project! This repository showcases a series of increasingly complex SQL queries written for a smart agriculture database system. The project demonstrates the use of <strong>MySQL</strong> to extract, analyze, and derive insights from agricultural data — supporting data-driven decision-making for modern farms.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Smart Farming DB</strong> is a fictional relational database designed to model various aspects of a smart farming operation — including farms, fields, crops, sensors, employees, suppliers, and harvesting data.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Practice and demonstrate SQL skills using a real-world use case</li>
    <li>Apply basic to advanced SQL queries on a normalized agricultural database</li>
    <li>Simulate queries that could be used in a real Smart Farming application</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL</li>
    <li><strong>SQL Concepts Covered:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic SELECT queries</li>
        <li>JOINs (INNER, LEFT)</li>
        <li>Aggregation (SUM, AVG)</li>
        <li>Filtering and Grouping</li>
        <li>Ranking (using window functions)</li>
        <li>Cumulative calculations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>SQL Query Tasks</h2>

  <h3> Basic Queries</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Retrieve farm names and locations</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to retrieve the names and locations of all farms."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>List all crops and their planting seasons</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to list all crops and their planting seasons."</em>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Intermediate Queries</h3>
  <ol start="3">
    <li><strong>Average temperature by sensor</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to find the average temperature recorded by each sensor."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Employees in Management department</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of all employees who work in the 'Management' department."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Crops planted in each field</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to list each field, along with the names of the crops planted in that field."</em>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Complex Queries</h3>
  <ol start="6">
    <li><strong>Total quantity harvested per crop in 2023</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to find the total quantity of each crop harvested across all fields in the year 2023."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Suppliers with high-value orders</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to identify suppliers who have supplied orders with a total amount greater than $10,000."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Field with highest average soil moisture per crop</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to find the field with the highest average soil moisture for each crop."</em>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Very Complex Queries</h3>
  <ol start="9">
    <li><strong>Rank employees by salary within departments</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to rank employees within each department by their salary, and return the employee's name, department, salary, and rank."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cumulative crop yield over time</strong><br>
      <em>"Write a SQL query to calculate the cumulative yield of each crop over time, showing the crop name, harvest date, quantity harvested, and the cumulative yield up to that date."</em>
    </li>
  </ol>
